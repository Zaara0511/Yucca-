# Yucca Website Clone 🌿

This project is a front-end clone of the Yucca website built using only HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project was to practice core web development fundamentals and improve my understanding of webpage structure and styling.

I focused on recreating the layout, spacing, typography, and overall visual design as closely as possible. The project helped me gain hands-on experience with semantic HTML, CSS styling, and layout alignment using Flexbox.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Structured layout using semantic HTML5
- Clean and organized CSS
- Flexbox for alignment and positioning
- Proper use of margins, padding, and spacing
- Basic responsive design principles
- Built completely from scratch (no frameworks)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
